GIT HEAD

- HiDPI display screen support (Qt >= 5.6). (EXPERIMENTAL)

- Old deprecated Qt4 build support is no more.

- AppData/AppStream metadata is now settled under an all
  permisssive license (FSFAP); also updated to be the most
  compliant with latest freedesktop.org specification and
  recommendation.

- Fixed for some g++ >= 8.1.1 warnings and quietness.


0.5.1  2018-05-21  Pre-LAC2018 release frenzy.

- A little hardening on the configure (autoconf) macro side.


0.5.0  2017-12-16  End of Autum'17 release.

- Desktop entry specification file is now finally independent
  from build/configure template chains.

  file (formerly AppData).


0.4.3  2017-04-27  Pre-LAC2017 release frenzy.

0.4.2  2016-11-14  A Fall'16 release.

  eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.


0.4.1  2016-09-14  End of Summer'16 release.

- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, while for Qtractor, thanks).


0.4.0  2016-04-05  Spring'16 release frenzy.

- Allegedly fixed for the socketopt(IP_MULTICAST_LOOP) reverse
  semantics on Windows platforms (as suggested by Paul Davis,

- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.


0.3.0  2015-09-21  Summer'15 release frenzy.

- System tray icon now blinks on network send/receive activity.

  which also gets some layout reform.

  now an user configurable option.


0.2.0  2014-06-19  Headless finally.

- A man page has beed added (making up Alessio Treglia's work on
  debian, thanks).

  GUI or system-tray icon accessibility, with all options given 
  as command line arguments.

0.1.2  2012-05-22  JACK-MIDI crashfix release.

- JACK MIDI in-bound buffering was originally flawed and often the
  cause for severe random crashes, mostly due to memory corruption,
  now hopefully fixed.

  the later is always owned by the current genuine process.
